## How It's Made:

## Tech used: HTML, CSS, NodeJS, Express, and Vanilla JavaScript
### The project is an e-commerce web application built using HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, NodeJS, and Express. It allows admin users to create an admin account and then add, edit, and delete sticker items that they would like to sell on the platform. In addition, customers can add items to a cart without the need to create or sign in to an account. The application utilizes Express for the server-side routing and NodeJS for the backend functionality. The frontend of the application is built using HTML and CSS for the layout and styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for the dynamic functionality such as form validation, displaying the list of items for sale, and adding items to the cart. The application has a role-based system, where admin users can login to their account and add, edit, and delete items from the platform, while customers can only browse and purchase items. This allows for a secure and efficient management of the e-commerce platform. The application provides a seamless and user-friendly experience for buying and selling stickers online, with the added functionality of an admin management system.

## Optimizations
### 1. Payment gateway integration : Integrate a payment gateway such as Stripe or PayPal to allow customers to make online payments securely.
### 2. Customer records: Implement a route that will allow validated customer users to save their shopping progress and complete their online transactions

## Lessons Learned:
### As a React developer and enthusisast this project has allowed me to hone in on my Javascript fundamentals. It's awesome to see the nuances of Javascript and have a picture of the reasons of the decisions the React team has made to create the library.
